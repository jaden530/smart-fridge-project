# Smart Fridge Project

A sophisticated kitchen management system that uses AI and computer vision to track inventory, suggest recipes, monitor nutrition, and prevent food waste.

## Features

- 🎯 **Inventory Management**: Automatic tracking of food items using computer vision
- 🍳 **Recipe Suggestions**: Smart recipe recommendations based on available ingredients
- 📊 **Health Tracking**: Monitor nutritional intake and progress towards health goals
- ♻️ **Waste Prevention**: Track expiration dates and get alerts for at-risk items
- 🔍 **Advanced Recipe Search**: Filter recipes by dietary restrictions, cooking time, and difficulty
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Assistant**: Chat with an AI kitchen assistant for cooking advice and help
- 📈 **Analytics**: Visual reports of inventory trends and nutritional data

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- PostgreSQL (optional, SQLite is used by default)
- OpenCV for computer vision
- FFmpeg for audio processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-fridge-project.git
cd smart-fridge-project
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:
```env
SPOONACULAR_API_KEY=your_spoonacular_api_key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///smartfridge.db  # Or your PostgreSQL URL
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
NUTRITIONIX_APP_ID=your_nutritionix_app_id
NUTRITIONIX_API_KEY=your_nutritionix_api_key
```

## Running the Application

1. Initialize the database:
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
flask run
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`
